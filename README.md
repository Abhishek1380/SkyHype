SkyHype : Homemade Food Marketplace
This project(SkyHype) aims to create a specialized online marketplace catering to individuals who prefer homemade food over restaurant meals. Unlike traditional food delivery platforms like Swiggy or Zomato who assist authorized food businesses which are relatively larger such as hotels, SkyHype will focuse exclusively on connecting users with small businesses and home chefs offering homemade dishes.
